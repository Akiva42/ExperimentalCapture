### Task

Using expanded capture techniques, realize the [lost/embarrassing] object virtually.

### Requirements and Constraints

* Regardless of any intermediate processes or materials that your concept may or may not require (e.g. clay, papier-mache, etc.), your final project must be a virtual manifestation. Acceptable projects are limited to one of the following forms: 
	* a real-time software executable (created, for example, in Unity3D, openFrameworks, Processing, three.js, etc.) (Note: *interactivity* is optional).
	* a video or computer-generated animation 
	* a computer-generated rendering 
* Regardless of any subsequent digital transformations you might apply, you must "capture" "something" real (using a "device") as the initial basis for your virtual manifestation. 
* Your virtual object must be presented on a neutral background. 


#### Details 

* **Create** a Markdown document called <code>project1.md</code> in your student folder. You will document your project in this file. 
* In this document, **write** a couple of paragraphs (150-250 words) about the experience of creating the piece. Critique your work: where do you feel you succeeded? Where do you feel you fell short of what you'd hoped to achieve? What did you learn? 
* *All* projects must be documented with at least one digital image at least 1600 pixels wide. 
* With the exception of still renderings, *all* projects will be documented through online video hosted on YouTube or Vimeo, and linked from the <code>project1.md</code> page. (Note, Markdown does not allow video embedding, so use the technique [described here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#videos).) Software executables must be documented with a screencaptured video. 
* **Submit** your files (<code>project1.md</code>, various images, etc.) in the form of a pull request to this repository.
