### Time-Lapse 
This Processing program for time-lapse recording connects to the computerâ€™s built-in web camera (or other attached video camera), and then stashes images from the camera to the hard disk at regular intervals. (The program will start recording consecutively-numbered images into the Sketch Folder for that program, which you can access from the Sketch menu. To compile a video from these images, import them into your favorite video editor, such as Quicktime Pro, AfterEffects or FinalCut).
