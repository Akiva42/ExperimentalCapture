# Tutorials

### Overview

Once during the semester, each student will be asked to produce a brief technical tutorial, the purpose of which is to help other students get some device or software package up and running quickly. Tutorials will be assigned to students through a negotiation process that takes the student's interests and abilities into consideration. In this way, students will develop and share expertise with the course equipment. 

The effort involved in producing these tutorials will be inhomogenous. In some cases, it will merely be necessary to create a YouTube video and write some nice clear instructions. In other cases, the student may also be asked to create a custom data parser (e.g. in Python), or develop some code to communicate with a novel device from an open-source arts-engineering toolkit such as [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) or [Processing](http://processing.org).
