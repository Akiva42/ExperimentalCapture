### Learning Objectives

This is an interdisciplinary course in experimental media practices that arise from using devices that "capture" the world. In this course, we seek:

* *To explore the affordances of exotic, forgotten, and nascent image capture technologies in revealing unseen or alternative realities.*
* *To explore the use of computation in expanding our expressive vocabulary for representations of people, objects, environments, and events.*
* *[To question the assumptions](docs/assumptions.md) that underpin the project of capturing representations of reality with devices.*

### Semester Projects

Our semester is organized around four main projects:

1. [An **Object**](docs/assignment1-object.md) *("Still Life")* - Due Wed. 9/23
1. [A **Person in Time**](docs/assignment2-person.md) *("Portrait")* - Due Mon. 10/19
1. [A **Place**](docs/assignment3-place.md) *("Landscape")* - Due Wed. 11/18
1. [Final Project](docs/assignment4-final.md): Due+Exhibited Wed. 12/9

Additionally, students must complete 10 brief "[**Looking Outwards**](docs/looking-outwards.md)" assignments, on an approximately weekly schedule.
