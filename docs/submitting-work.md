# Submitting Work

All student assignments in this course will take the form of Markdown pages submitted as pull requests through Github. Our course repo is: [https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/). For information on using Git and Github, see [this page](git.md). 

Requirements for each of the different assignment types are available below: 

* Expectations for *[Looking Outwards](looking-outwards.md)* assignments.
* Expectations for *[Technical Tutorial](tutorials.md)* assignments.
* Expectations for Projects 1, 2, and 3 (below) 
* Expectations for the Final Project (below)

### Expectations for Projects 1, 2, and 3

* Create a unique Markdown document for your Project report.
* Be sure to put your name and title of the work at the top of the page. 
* Include a one-sentence "tweetable" description of your project, that answers the question: *what is it?*
* Include at least one static documentation image, such as a screenshot, of a good quality.
* All projects must be documented in a YouTube or Vimeo video. Include a link to this video, ideally with a thumbnail image. 
* For good measure, if appropriate, include an animated GIF documenting your project. 
* Write approximatly 200 words about your project, describing its development process, both technically and conceptually. In your writing, include some critical analysis of your project: how could it have been better? In what ways did you succeed, and in what ways could it be better?
* Include scans of notebook sketches, technical diagrams, etc. if you have them.
* Link to any code you developed for the project. 

Related to our course policies on Academic Integrity, you must also:

* Name any other students from the class with whom you collaborated on your Project, and explain how the work was distributed among the collaborators.
* Cite and link to the sources for any code, papers, algorithms, external libraries, or other media (e.g. photographs, soundtracks) which you used in your Project.

### Expectations for the Final Project

It is expected (but not required) that the Final Project will be a revised version of one of the first three projects. 

* *If you elect to revise an earlier project,* it is acceptable to revise its original report page, as long as you retain documentation of the project at its earlier stage, i.e. "show the process". So if you revise your *Portrait* project, be sure to keep images/videos of the project from its first go-around. You may wish to re-organize your report to include this information in a "process" discussion. 
* *If you elect to create a new project for the Final,* then create a new report as with the other Projects.
